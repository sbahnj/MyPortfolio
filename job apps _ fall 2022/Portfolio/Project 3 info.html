									<h2>Pok&eacutemon Database</h2>

									<img src="images/ERD_image.jpg" alt="" width="500"/>

									<p>A database of Pok&eacutemon species and tournament results. </p>

									<h3>Problem</h3>
									<p>For a prospective competitor in Pok&eacutemon tournaments, it can be difficult to choose
										their team of Pok&eacutemon characters. It is to a competitor's advantage to choose a team
									that reflects current winning trends in competition. However, tournament results are not
									available in a consolidated, searchable format.</p>

									<h3>Solution</h3>

									<h4>Database Design</h4>
									<p>Using SQL, we designed a database containing all Pok&eacutemon species, as well as the results
										from recent tournaments. For each species, we included information about its abilities and type.
										Each Pok&eacutemon team consists of unique individuals that are examples of their species.
										This structure allowed us to store both team and species data.
										Linking team members with their species characteristics allows for searches such as species frequency or
										ability frequency in tournaments. We could also observe trends in teams belonging to individual
										competitors.</p>

									<h4>Web Scraping</h4>


									<p>In order to populate the database, we used Python to scrape both tournament results and
										Pok&eacutemon species information from the web. During this process, we needed to
										account for the differing structure of the webpages we scraped. For each set of pages,
										we needed to find where the required information was located. One limitation of our data
										was that the specific stats for each team member were not available. Though we were able
										to apply the stats possessed by Pok&eacutemon species in general, we could not
										precisely determine how each team member developed their species' abilities.
									</p>

									<p>We then inserted this information into our database tables using SQL. Pok&eacutemon information
										contained on the webpages was occasionally inaccurate, due to human error when the pages were updated.
										To prevent these errors
										from being transferred to the database, we established triggers to prevent inaccurate Pok&eacutemon
										from being added.</p>

									<h4>User Interface</h4>
									<p>We designed a user interface to allow the database to be updated. Users can enter information
										for new competitions, teams, and tournament results in the drop down menus, text entry fields, and radio
										buttons.
										This feature was important because new tournaments are held each year, and in order for the
										database to be most useful, it should include the latest competition results. </p>

									<h4>Data Analysis</h4>
									<p>Our data analysis showed that certain species were used more often than others, and that
										species with high Attack abilities were often favored by competitors. The overall competition
										trend shows that team composition is becoming more species-balanced over time. This may be because a
										balanced team gives greater competitive advantage, and/or because certain species have been modified
										to reduce their comparative advantage. One thing we learned during the course of this
									project is the importance of confirming the initial accuracy of one's data source. This is particularly
									imperative when gathering data from sources that may not have been reviewed for accuracy, such as
									crowd-sourced websites. The use of triggers to catch inaccuracies before the data is loaded is one
									solution, though this step requires an expert in the field to first identify the possible errors,
									so that a trigger can be written to prevent them.</p>
