									<h2>Decision-making tool prototype</h2>

									<img src="images/BoneHealthTitle.jpg" alt="" width="800" />


									<h3>Problem</h3>
									<p>During medical appointments, patients are often required to make decisions regarding their
									healthcare. In order to make these decisions, patients have to weigh complicated medical
									information that can be difficult to understand.</p>

									<h3>Solution</h3>
									<p>The decision-making tool is designed for use during medical appointments.
									Using the tool, the patient and their doctor can explore the available
									treatment options, coming to a decision that makes medical sense for the patient,
									and that fits in with the patient's abilities, personal goals, and values.</p>

									<p>Our project goal was to update an existing tool that was designed for use
									during medical appointments discussing bone health, including conditions such
									as osteoporosis and osteopenia.</p>

									<h3>Design Process</h3>
									<p>In order to update the current tool, we needed to discover what patients'
									needs are during medical appointments, by finding out what questions they ask and what concerns they have.
										In addition, we needed to update the tool to include the newest available medications.</p>

									<h4>Observation of medical appointments</h4>
									<p>We observed and recorded encounters with patients and clinicians where bone
									health was discussed. We noted patients' questions and concerns, and also
									which issues clinicians prioritized during the appointment. These observations helped us
									narrow down the possible issues that the tool might present for discussion.</p>

									<h4>Consultation with clinicians</h4>
									<p>We asked clinicians which new medications should be presented to patients.
									We worked with clinicians to describe the effects and risks of these medications
									in language that was both easy to understand and medically accurate. This step required us
									to decide which information might be helpful in making medical decisions, and which information
									might be omitted or left up to the doctor to discuss. It was important not to present too much
									information in the tool, since this would lead to information fatigue for patients.</p>

									<h4>Prototype iteration</h4>
									<p>Using Axure, we performed iterations on a tool prototype. We met with clinicians
									throughout this process, to make sure that the information being presented was
									correct, and that the content included in the tool would be useful during a
									medical consultation.</p>

									<h5>Framing the problem</h5>

									<p>In early prototypes, we considered how the issue of bone health could be presented
										to the patient. For example, the issue could be presented as a named medical condition,
										such as osteoporosis. Alternatively, the issue could be presented as the negative effect of a bone fracture. </p>

									<!-- Slideshow container -->
									<div class="slideshow-container">

										<!-- Full-width images with number and caption text -->
										<div class="mySlides fade">
											<div class="numbertext">1 / 3</div>
											<img src="images/Condition.3.9.jpg" style="width:100%" onclick="plusSlides(1)">
											<div class="text">Bone health as a specific medical condition</div>
										</div>

										<div class="mySlides fade" >
											<div class="numbertext">2 / 3</div>
											<img src="images/Effects.3.9.jpg" style="width:100%" onclick="plusSlides(1)">
											<div class="text">Bone health as a cause of fracture</div>
										</div>



										<!-- Next and previous buttons -->
										<a class="prev" onclick="plusSlides(-1)">&#10094; </a>
										<a class="next" onclick="plusSlides(1)">&#10095;</a>
									</div>
									<br>

									<!-- The dots/circles -->
									<div style="text-align:center">
										<span class="dot" onclick="currentSlide(1)"></span>
										<span class="dot" onclick="currentSlide(2)"></span>
										
									</div>





									<p>In later iterations of the tool, we emphasized the effects that poor bone health could
									have on patients' lives, such as fracture. With this approach, we hoped to present the issue
									of bone health in terms that people could identify with. </p>


									<h5>Revising the medication list</h5>

									<p>In order to include the newest medications, the prototype needed several more iterations.
										The list of medications needed revision to include only the meds that were most often
										used during appointments. We also needed to consider what sort of information about each
										med would be most useful to patients and their doctors.</p>

									<img style="float left" src="images/Meds.3.16.jpg" alt="" width="1000"  />

									<p>In a later prototype, the list of medications was edited. Only the most common
										medications are presented, and their possible impact on patients' daily lives is
										emphasized.</p>


									<img src="images/MedRoutine.7.1.jpg" alt="" width="1000"  />

									<p>Patients were also shown their risk of fracture in a visual format, both with and
										without the option of medication.</p>
